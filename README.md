  ## Requirements
  Type the following in the console:
  ```
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```
  ## Usage
  There are 2 files in this github repo as I am writing this, a 'dates.txt' and 'autolister.py' file. 
  You will have to modify the 'dates.txt' file by adding or removing the component papers as you wish.
  You must add the papers in the order:
  
  **Name, Paper, Date Month, Time**
  
  ex: Chemistry, P1, 04 Jun, AM

  #### You may fork this repo, commit using better code and call my program suboptimal, should you wish,
  #### All i ask is that you explain what you did. I am trying to learn after all...
